# Dynamic and automatic validation process based device of Cisco Family

The process developed here are related with different modules of Ansible and using functions by NAPALM.

This project has idea to collect automatically in Cisco device your module/family via "get_facts" and after that we could create and developed your scripts based in some rules using a static inventory built in csv file and organize those script creating different tasks.

For this example none module were execute to access device and implement scripts, however this action is only add module "ios_config"

If you have more idea fell free to contact to build this developed.
